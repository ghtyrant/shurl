Shurl
=====
Shurl is a minimal URL shortener service using Python, web.py. URLs are stored in a database. There is no user interface for entering URLs, URLs are shortened through a POST request to http://youraddress/new. Writing a simple HTML form for this should be trivial. There is no automatic purging of URLs, you have to do this yourself.
